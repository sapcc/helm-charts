# NOTE: When upgrading please note the following changes:
#
# 1.4.0
# - image.repository and metrics.image.repository as well as their
#   imagePullPolicy settings are now hardcoded.
# - The Redis image now comes from ccloud/shared-app-images/redis. Please update
#   your image.tag pins accordingly (see comment in values.yaml).
#
# 1.5.0
# - the deployment will be rolled out (restarted) on password and configuration
#   Secrets changes.
#
# 1.6.0
# - Switched from Redis to its fork Valkey because of the Redis license change.
#   The image now comes from ccloud/shared-app-images/valkey.
#   If you have image.tag pins (which we recommend against), please update them accordingly.
#
# 2.0.0
# - Cleaned up useless variability and other clutter:
#   - The field `.Values.nameOverride` was removed.
#     If you need multiple Redis instances in a single chart, use dependency aliasing.
#   - The fields `.Values.redisPort` and `Values.metrics.port` were removed.
#     Apps now always use their default ports (6379 for Redis, 9121 for metrics).
#   - The redis-exporter deployment was renamed from `...-redis-metrics` to `...-redis-exporter`
#     to allow for a cleanup of the pod labels. Other than that, the pod behaves the same.
# - Passwords can now be auto-generated instead of pulling them from Vault.
#   See documentation on field `.Values.redisPassword` for details.
# - Support for setting `.Values.redisPassword` explicitly is deprecated.
#   This field may be removed in a subsequent major version bump.
#
# 2.1.0
# - The field `.Values.redis.alerts.support_group` must now be provided by the parent chart.
#
# 2.1.1
# - Support deploying without alerts (e.g. local development)
#
# 2.2.0
# - Added values to control `stakater/Reloader` annotations of generated
#   secrets and consuming workloads. See
#   `.Values.reloader.annotateGeneratedSecrets` and
#   `.Values.metrics.reloader.enabled`
#
# 2.2.10, 2.2.11
# - Fix reloader.annotateGeneratedSecrets not annotating generated secrets
version: 2.2.13 # this version number is SemVer as it gets used to auto bump
