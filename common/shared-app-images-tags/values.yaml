# Image references are not stored here, but in `files/tags.json`, where they
# cannot easily be accessed without the provided template functions. The reason
# for that is that, if we were to put image references in here, and then an
# image version falls out of support, references like
#
# ```
# {{ index .Values "shared-app-images-tags" "alpine-busybox" "3.22" }}
# ```
#
# would silently break and evaluate to an empty string, which will be accepted
# by Helm, but then cause errors on Kubernetes level. To avoid this, we force
# users to go through the provided template function API, which will provide a
# more explicit error at Helm template evaluation time.
