# Changelog

## v0.24.0 - 2025/04/16
* MariaDB has been updated to the 10.6.21 version
  * delete removed `innodb_thread_concurrency` variable from my.cnf

See related documentation at https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-10-5-to-mariadb-10-6/

The default value of the `old_mode` variable is `UTF8_IS_UTF8MB3` until MariaDB 11.2.

## v0.23.0 - 2025/04/10
* reloader annotation has been added to the backup-v2 deployment, so backup-v2 deployment always uses updated credentials

## v0.22.0 - 2025/04/09
* delete unmanaged localhost users like 'username'@'localhost'

Previously, init.sql script was creating a pair of users: 'username'@'%' and 'username'@'localhost'. The second one stopped being managed since the introduction of granular user configuration in 2022. These @'localhost' users will be removed now.

## v0.21.0 - 2025/04/08
* remove version label from mariadb deployment pod template and related configmaps to avoid unnecessary database restarts on simple chart version update

## v0.20.0 - 2025/04/03
* add `renameCheckConstraints`  job, which allows to rename constraints, created by sqlalchemy with names like `CONSTRAINT_*`, to constraints with a unique name, as MySQL does

Context: by default, alembic migrations creating a boolean column causes sqlalchemy to create a check constraint without a specified name like this:
```sql
CONSTRAINT `CONSTRAINT_1` CHECK (`enabled` in (0,1))
```
MariaDB's default behavior is to name constraints like 'CONSTRAINT_1', 'CONSTRAINT_2', and so on. The constraint name being unique per table.
The default behaviour of MySQL (or Percona Server / Percona XtraDB Cluster) is to name constraints like 'table_chk_1', 'table_chk_2', and so on. The constraint name must be unique per database.
This makes data migration from MariaDB to MySQL impossible without renaming constraints, because mysqldump of MariaDB contains many non-unique constraint names.
To solve this problem and make a database dump compatible with MySQL, these constraints should be renamed (recreated) using unique names.

### Job configuration example
```yaml
job:
  renameCheckConstraints:
    enabled: true
```

## v0.19.1 - 2025/04/02
* `set-root-password` init container now always tries to create `'root'@'localhost'` and `'root'@'%'` user if it doesn't exist
  * this helps to avoid lock-out issue, if this user was previously deleted

## v0.19.0 - 2025/03/25
* Remove the following internal helm template helper functions:
  * `keystone_url`
  * `mariadb.db_host`
  * `mariadb.root_password`
  * `mariadb.resolve_secret`

## v0.18.2 - 2025/03/21
* add missing headers to the mariadb-credential-updater.py
* remove unused `credentialUpdater.enabled` option from values - this sidecar is non-optional

## v0.18.1 - 2025/03/21
* make backup storage to AWS and Swift flexibel via enablement in `backup-v2` configuration

## v0.18.0 - 2025/03/07
* add credential-updater sidecar, that reapplies init.sql on the detected change
* make init.sql not optional
* remove pre-change job, because it's no longer needed with the above sidecar
* add missing owner labels to initdb secret

## v0.17.3 - 2025/03/06
* start database with init.sql to always update root password on start

## v0.17.2 - 2025/03/05
* use `shared-app-images/alpine-kubectl` image for pre-change job instead of outdated `unified-kubernetes-toolbox`, that is supposed to be used in CI

## v0.17.1 - 2025/03/04
* use local unix_socket connection for all status checks and mysqld_upgrade
  * this would allow to change root password without intermittent liveness check failure
  * this would allow to use `'` and `\` in root password in mysqld_upgrade
* use monitor user with limited privileges for metrics sidecar

## v0.17.0 - 2025/02/27
* use custom entrypoint script for mariadb deployment
  * remove non-optional and `healthcheck` user creation

## v0.16.10 - 2025/02/27

  - the[README.md](README.md#analyzetable) is updated with the new maintenance job details
- chart version bumped

## v0.16.1 - 2025/02/18
* enquote password in /root/.my.cnf
  * this would allow to use `=` and `#` symbols in password
* chart version bumped

## v0.16.0 - 2025/02/17
* remove user and password from readiness and liveness probes
  * `/root/.my.cnf` is used instead
