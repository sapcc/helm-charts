Prometheus server Chart
-----------------------

This chart shall serve as a template to deploy your own Prometheus.  
It will set up:
- Prometheus server instance (with 2 sidecars: configmap, rules reload)
- Persistent volume claim (if configured; default off)
- Ingress to manage external access for the Prometheus instance. (default off)
- RBAC resources for the Prometheus. Might be required if e.g. when service discoveries are used. (default off)
- A basic set of [alerts for the Prometheus server](./templates/alerts) itself

## Prerequisite

This chart relies on resources brought to you by the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator).  
It may be installed using the [official helm chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-operator).

## Scrape configuration

A default scrape configuration ifor service, endpoint and pod service discovery is part of this chart and deployed via [ServiceMonitors](./templates/servicemonitors),
[PodMonitors](./templates/podmonitors) and via [configuration](./examples/prometheus.yaml).
It can be disabled via values.  
See the official specification on [ServiceMonitor](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/api.md#servicemonitor) 
and [PodMonitor](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/api.md#podmonitor) for additional information.  

### Providing additional scrape configurations

Additional scrape configuration is provided via a secret referenced by the `additionalScrapeConfigs.name` and `additionalScrapeConfigs.key` parameters.  
See the `prometheus.yaml` and `additional-scrape-config.yaml` in the [examples](./examples) folder.

## Aggregation and Alerting rules

Aggregation and alerting rules can be deployed independently of the Prometheus server instance using the `PrometheusRule` CRD.  
An example can be found [here](./examples/kubernetes-health.alerts.yaml).  
Rules are assigned to a Prometheus instance by setting labels on the PrometheusRule as shown below. Refers to the `name` of the Prometheus as describe above.
```
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule

metadata:
  labels:
    prometheus: < name of the prometheus to which the rule should be assigned to >
  ...
```

## Integrate custom Service Discovery (SD)

To integrate a [custom SD](https://prometheus.io/blog/2018/07/05/implementing-custom-sd/#implementing-custom-service-discovery) one needs to provide the scrape configuration
```
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "custom-sd"
    scrape_interval: "15s"
    file_sd_configs:
    - files:
      - /etc/prometheus/config/custom_sd.json
```

and have the Kubernetes configmap containing the `custom_sd.json` mounted to the Prometheus server by setting
```
configMaps:
  - <name of the configmap containing the custom_sd.json`
```

## Thanos (Long-term storage for metrics)

This chart supports [Thanos](https://github.com/improbable-eng/thanos) out-of-the-box.
See [Thanos docs](./templates/thanos/README.md) for additional details specific to the SAP Converged Cloud Enterprise Edition.

## Configuration

The following table provides an overview of configurable parameters of this chart and their defaults.  
See the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) for more details.  
**TLDR;** Set the `name`, `global.region`, `global.tld` parameters and get started where `name` has to be a unique identifier for your prometheus.
