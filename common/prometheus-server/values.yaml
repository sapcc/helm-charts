# Enabled default Prometheus Service Discoveries (SD).
# The relabeling allows the actual service scrape endpoint to be configured
# via the following annotations:
#
# * `prometheus.io/scrape`:   Only scrape services that have a value of `true`
# * `prometheus.io/targets`:  List of target Prometheis by which the metrics should be scraped.
# * `prometheus.io/scheme`:   If the metrics endpoint is secured then you will need to set this to `https` & most likely set the `tls_config` of the scrape config.
# * `prometheus.io/path`:     If the metrics path is not `/metrics` override this.
# * `prometheus.io/port`:     If the metrics are exposed on a different port to the service then set this appropriately.
