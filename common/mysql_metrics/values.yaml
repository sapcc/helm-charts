  # The maximum available capacity is split evenly across containers specified in the Deployment, StatefulSet or DaemonSet to derive the upper recommendation bound. This does not work out for pods with a single resource-hungry container with several sidecar containers
  # Annotate the Deployment, StatefulSet or DaemonSet with vpa-butler.cloud.sap/main-container=$MAIN_CONTAINER. That will distribute 75% of the maximum available capacity to the main container and the rest evenly across all others

## can be used to add additional metric sources, e.g. a nova cell database in the format:
## mysql://user:pass@tcp(host:3306)/db_name
customSources: []

## nova-only switch for adding cell2 db as another source for exporter:
queryCell2: false
