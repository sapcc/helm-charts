# Operator can be deployed in a different namespace than the managed resources.
# Important: The cinder volume deployment needs to be deployed
# into the same namespace as the managed_resources_namespace.
# Currently, the netappfilerwatcher resource owns the netapfiler resources it creates and
# the netappfiler owns the cinder volume deployments created by 
# the operator. Ownership across namespaces is not supported by kubernetes.
