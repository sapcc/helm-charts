    # "Stabilization" refers to these metrics not flapping and changing labels on restarts of limes-collect (e.g. because of deployment):
    # - Each raw metric is wrapped in `last_over_time(<metric>[15m])` to avoid alerts disappearing when the collector is restarted and the metrics vanish because the new collector takes a few moments to start up.
    # - Each raw metric is then also wrapped in `max by (<relevant labels>) (<expr>)` to avoid time series from the old and new collector appearing at the same time. This would cause many-to-many matching errors and also cause the alert to flap.
