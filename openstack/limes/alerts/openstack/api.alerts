      description: |
        The DB connection pool on pod {{ $labels.kubernetes_pod_name }} is filling up. It can
        go up to 16 connections, but during regular operations we should not go
        over 3-5 connections to retain some budget for request spikes. Going
        high on connections for a long time indicates that the pod might be
        starved for CPU time, so try checking the CPU throttling metrics.
