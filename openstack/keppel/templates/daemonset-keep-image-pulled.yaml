# Because Keppel is instrumental for the continued availability of many other
# Docker images, we want to be able to start it reliably and fast. To ensure this,
# this daemonset (through its existence) keeps the Keppel image permanently
# pulled on all nodes.
#
# The condition above skips this daemonset on QA and lab regions, because high
# availability is not a concern there. By omitting the daemonset there, the
# Helm deployment will finish faster since it does not have to wait on it.
