# Swift is the backing store for Keppel. Therefore Swift is instrumental for
# the continued availability of many other Docker images, so we want to be able
# to start it reliably and fast. To ensure this, this daemonset (through its
# existence) keeps the relevant images permanently pulled on all nodes.
#
# The condition above skips this daemonset on QA and lab regions, because high
# availability is not a concern there. By omitting the daemonset there, the
# Helm deployment will finish faster since it does not have to wait on it.
