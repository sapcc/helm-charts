# Swift is the backing store for Keppel. Therefore Swift is instrumental for
# the continued availability of many other Docker images, so we want to be able
# to start it reliably and fast. To ensure this, this daemonset (through its
# existence) keeps the relevant images permanently pulled on all nodes.
