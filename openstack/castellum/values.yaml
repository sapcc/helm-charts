    # There is a lot to unpack in this query. Reading from the inside out:
    # 1. We want to be alerted when an asset is at a critical usage level, but
    #    Castellum is not doing anything about it. That's what the WHERE describes.
    # 2. To quantify the "not doing anything" part, the metric value is the
    #    time since the last critical upsize was performed on that asset. We
    #    RIGHT OUTER JOIN instead of a simple JOIN since there may not be a
    #    finished operation for that asset at all.
    # 3. The inner SELECT query would be enough to power the alert. But if we
    #    do just that, we would be creating a ton of useless timeseries that live
    #    for only a few minutes. The timeseries appears when the asset is scraped
    #    and usage is critical, and it disappears in the next scrape after the
    #    size was adjusted. Since scrapes occur every 5 minutes, we only create
    #    the timeseries at the 6 minute mark, so most of them will be avoided.
