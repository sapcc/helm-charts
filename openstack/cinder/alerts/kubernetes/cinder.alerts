    # This is a copy of [Sebastian Krott's](https://github.com/seb-kro) 
    # [nova nanny alert](https://github.com/sapcc/helm-charts/commit/b9cfda5fa068221c19d56d7d34e2bcbf50e214da).
    #
    # We need to cover two distinct scenarios. Jobs that consistently terminate
    # with an error and a jobs that do not terminate. We rely on the following
    # assumptions
    # - cronjobs schedule multiple jobs per day
    # - cronjobs have `concurrencyPolicy: Forbid`, i.e., no new jobs are
    # scheduled while a previous job is still running
    # We trigger an alert if all of the three following conditions hold true:
    # 1) The cronjob was created at least 24h ago.
    # 2) No job has terminated successfully within the last 24h.
    # NOTE: `time() - kube_cronjob_status_last_successful_time` does not exist
    # for a cronjob that has never terminated successfully. In this case, we
    # use `kube_cronjob_status_last_schedule_time` as a default. This exists as
    # soon as the first job is running and is always >= 24h since we directly
    # use the timestamp instead of the timedelta.
    # 3) A job has been scheduled within the last 24h OR at least one job is
    # currently active.
    # NOTE: This prevents the alert from firing if a cronjob is disabled. The
    # first part holds true for jobs that are consistently failing. But if a job
    # does not terminate, then new jobs were no longer scheduled. So we cover
    # non-terminating jobs by the second part.
