## Storage driver to use. One of 'configmap', 'memory', or 'secret'
storage: configmap

tls:
  ## Enable TLS encryption between Helm and Tiller
  enabled: false

  ## Verify remote certificate
  verify: true

  ## A custom secret to mount instead of specifying Base64 Values below
  secretName: ""

  ## Specify a Base64 encoded CA
  # ca: "Zm9vCg=="

  ## Specify a Base64 encoded cert
  # cert: "Zm9vCg=="

  ## Specify a Base64 encoded private key
  # key: "Zm9vCg=="

## The following options specify the Role or ClusterRole to assign to the
## tiller service account. The ClusterRole "admin" is usually pre-defined in
## RBAC-enabled clusters and will allow administration of a namespace by
## whatever users or ServiceAccounts are bound to it in that same namespace.
## THERE IS SELDOM ANY REASON TO OVERRIDE THIS!!!
role:
  ## Valid values are "Role" or "ClusterRole"
  type: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin

## Security options. The default values close known attack vectors.
## ALTER THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!

## Note that these tight restrictions do NOT impede normal use of Helm. Helm
## is always usable with any Tiller as long as the Helm user has permission to
## tunnel into pods in that Tiller's namespace.
## (Helm does this automatically.)

## Specify whether to include a service of type ClusterIP for Tiller
includeService: false

## Specify whether Tiller pods should listen to 0.0.0.0 or just localhost
onlyListenOnLocalhost: true

## We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
## choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
## resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
## lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
resources: {}
# limits:
#  cpu: 100m
#  memory: 128Mi
# requests:
#  cpu: 100m
