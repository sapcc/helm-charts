<p>This check validates required labels on Pods.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Why is this a problem?</dt>
  <dd>
    Each Pod should have a <code>ccloud/support-group</code> label containing the name of the support group
    that is responsible for it. Optionally, the <code>ccloud/service</code> label can be added to further route alerts
    within the support group. These labels will be used for routing generic pod alerts.
    <br><br>
    Please refer to <a href="https://operations.global.cloud.sap/docs/support/operation_model/tags/">the operations documentation</a>
    for more details on the labels that drive our support process.
  </dd>
  <dt>How to fix?</dt>
  <dd>
    Add the missing labels, as reported. Usually you do not have to maintain labels on individual pod specs. They will
    be added automatically if you have <a href="https://github.com/sapcc/helm-charts/tree/master/common/owner-info">owner-info</a>
    defined on the level of the Helm chart.
  </dd>
  <dt>I have added owner-info, but my deployments are still reported here. What's going on?</dt>
  <dd>
    For pods that are managed by a deployment/daemonset/statefulset/job, this check expects labels on the PodSpec.
    (We do not check every individual pod because the large number of violations would overwhelm the audit process.)
    However, for existing deployments etc., we avoid unintentional pod restarts by not changing the PodSpec unless the
    deployment is actively changed. To force an update of the labels in the PodSpec, run <code>kubectl label $KIND/$NAME
    ccloud/support-group-</code> on the object containing the PodSpec. Note that this will do a rolling restart of all
    pods. For example:
  </dd>
  <pre><code>kubectl label deployment/nginx ccloud/support-group-</code></pre>
</dl>
