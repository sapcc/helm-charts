  <dt>Where to find vulnerability reports?</dt>
  <dd>
    Copy-paste the path part of the image (e.g.
    &quot;keppel.eu-de-1.cloud.sap/ccloud/limes&quot;) into your browser address bar. This
    opens the image list for that repo in Elektra's Keppel UI. Find the relevant image
    (look for a vulnerability status other than &quot;Clean&quot;) and open its details
    view to find the vulnerabilities on the &quot;Vulnerabilities&quot; tab. If
    you cannot see such a tab, you are on a multi-arch image. Drill down into
    the x86_64 component image to see the vulnerability report.
