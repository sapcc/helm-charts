  - name: gatekeeper

    version: 3.20.0
    # repository: https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/charts

    # ^ We have to vendor to apply custom patches for linkerd support.
    # To upgrade to a new version:
    # - Flip to the commented-out `repository` line.
    # - Run `helm dep up`.
    # - Wipe `vendor/gatekeeper-upstream` and unpack `charts/gatekeeper-$VERSION.tgz` there.
    # - Review the diff (e.g. `git add -p`).
    #   - Accept changes from upstream.
    #   - Reject the deletion of linkerd annotations.
    #   - If upstream changes add new pods, add linkerd annotations as necessary.
    # - Flip back to the original `repository` line here.
